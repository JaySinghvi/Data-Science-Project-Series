# Data-Science-Project-Series

The projects listed here are my experience from working as a Data Science Intern at Nexus Info. The first project is Stock Market Prediction and second project is Breast cancer prediction. 
The dataset for the first project were taken from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/luisandresgarcia/stock-market-prediction
The dataset for the second project was provided by the institution itself.
